- `UV-metric_pKa_experiment_reports\` -  This directory contains reports generated by Sirius T3 software for the results of pKa measurements. Refer to pKa_replicate_experimental_results.csv for matching SAMPL6 molecule IDs to names of report files.                               
- `UV-metric_pKa_experiment_reports_of_extra_cosolvent_experiments\` - This directory contains reports generated by Sirius T3 software for the results of extra pKa measurements performed with cosolvent method (Yasuda-Shedlovsky Extrapolation). These molecules already have UV-metric pKa measurements in 100% water. These extra experiments were collected only to evaluate if there is a bias in pKa measurement method that uses cosolvent.
