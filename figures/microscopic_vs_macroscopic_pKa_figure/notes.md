I constructed microscopic vs macroscopic pKa distribution of species plots using NMR data of cetirizine from the following publications:

Marosi, Attila, Zsuzsanna Kovács, Szabolcs Béni, József Kökösi, and Béla Noszál. “Triprotic Acid–base Microequilibria and Pharmacokinetic Sequelae of Cetirizine.” European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 37, no. 3–4 (June 2009): 321–28. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2009.03.001.

There was a mistake in calculation of macroscopic populations of UV-metric experiment. That is corrected now.
